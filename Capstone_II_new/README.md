Using the computational data on primary dnedritic arm spacing (PDAS) generated by myself, I developed a linear regression model to predict the correlation
between the PDAS with solidification velocity and temeprature gradient. This machine learning model can be used as an alternative to the analytical models
that fail to accurately predict the PDAS
